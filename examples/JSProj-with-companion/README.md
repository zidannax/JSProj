# @JSProj/companion example

This is a simple, lean example that combines the usage of @JSProj/companion and JSProj client.

## Test it

To run this example, make sure you've correctly installed the **repository root**:

```bash
corepack yarn install
corepack yarn create
```

That will also install the dependencies for this example.

Then, again in the **repository root**, start this example by doing:

```bash
corepack yarn workspace @JSProj-example/JSProj-with-companion start
```
